# Firefox-Userscripts

### Open a New Tab

A simple script to open a new tab from the context menu.  

If used from within a Firefox container, the new tab remains in that container.

Due to Firefox limitations, a userscript can not open `about:newtab`.  Therefore, `about:blank` is opened by default.
